# Bokumo Recorder

This is a web app to record voicebanks for singing voice synthesizers, such as UTAU.

## Why not use OREMO?

You _should_ use OREMO, if you are able to.

However, my computer runs on an Apple M1 chip.
At the time of writing, OREMO is not supported on M1 (at least, as far as I know).

So, if you are unable to run OREMO for whatever reason, I recommed using this app.
You can think of it unofficially as "OREMO online".

## Contribution

Contributions are welcome.

However, at this time, I do not plan on contributing much more code to this project myself.
So, if you submit a feature request, you'll need to implement the feature yourself (unless someone else wants to implement it for you), and open a PR.
