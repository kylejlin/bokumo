# Sample `bokumo.json` files and BGM files

I threw the BGM together in ten minutes or so, using GarageBand.
Use it at your own risk.
It's a little loud, but you can always turn down the volume on
your device.

I included the GarageBand project (in [bgm.band](./bgm.band)) in case you want to modify it.
